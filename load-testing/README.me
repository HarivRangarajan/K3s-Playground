# This directory handles load-testing according to the given NASA.csv file
- Uses Grafana's K6 library: https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/
- a total of MAX_REQUESTS virtual users (VUs) will be spun up
- every second, they will have a request_count / MAX_REQUESTS chance of sending out a HTTP request_count
- therefore, the request rate every second matches each row (minute) of the csv file in expectation

Instructions:
Simply run
`k6 run ./load-testing/nasa.js`

If you wish to test more rows (default: 10), change the DURATION global variable in nasa.js
